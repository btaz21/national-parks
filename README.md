## Git Strategy

1. No pushes to git origin dev or git origin master. EVER.
2. When you are finished working on changes to your local feature, do a git push origin <name_feature>
3. Any merge will be done on the site itself by comparing name_feature with dev branch.
4. Group member who is ready to merge changes should send message in Slack to other group members so we can go over the merge together.
5. Delete branch once it's been merged.
6. Whenever any sort of merge is done in github, make sure to do a git pull origin dev.
